# Accretion Expansion Hypothesis

According to goolgle:

"do black holes grow over time?"

"Yes, black holes can grow over time. They grow by accreting matter from their surroundings and by merging with other black holes. This means they essentially "eat" stars, gas clouds, dust, and even other black holes that get too close, increasing their mass and thus their size."

"is the universe expanding from a fixed point?"

"No, the universe is not expanding from a fixed point. It's expanding everywhere at once. Imagine a balloon being inflated; every point on the balloon's surface moves away from every other point, and there's no center point on the surface from which the expansion originates. Similarly, in our universe, all points are moving away from each other as space itself expands. "

## Origin:
The universe originates from a black hole singularity in a parent universe. The singularity forms a **2D symmetry state (0)**, as defined in the Foundational Asymmetry Theory (FAT). When time curves into this state, awareness and entropy emerge.

## Core Correction:
The black hole does **not stop** after forming the initial 0. It **continues to accumulate** matter and spacetime from the parent universe, feeding into the internal curvature.

This **ongoing intake** expands the internal universeâ€”not through an explosive Big Bang, but as a **growing structure**, like a child being nourished from the outside.

## Dark Energy Reframed:
Dark energy is not a separate, mysterious force. It is the **effect of continuous curvature expansion**, caused by the flow of mass and spacetime into the singularity from the outside universe.

### Reformulated:
> Dark Energy = Structural Effect of External Feeding into the 0

As more matter enters, the 0 grows internally. This growth creates the appearance of expansion from within.

## Structural Consequences:

1. **No Fixed Expansion Point**:
   - Expansion occurs uniformly because the internal curvature is fed everywhere from the outside, not from a single origin.

2. **Ongoing Expansion**:
   - As long as the parent black hole grows, so does our internal universe. This introduces **structural asymmetry** over time.

3. **Dark Energy as a Function**:
   - Dark energy corresponds to the **rate of curvature increase** based on mass-energy intake from the parent universe.

## Summary:

> The universe expands not from an initial explosion, but through continuous intake of mass-energy from a parent black hole.  
> This process defines dark energy as the **curvature growth** of the internal universe.  
> AEH now frames the cosmos as **a growing child**, not a one-time event.


### ðŸ”š Terminal Phase: Black Hole Decay and the End of External Growth

As predicted by Hawking radiation, the parent black hole from which our universe originates will eventually decay. This decay marks a critical structural transition:

- **Causal Decoupling**: Once the black hole decays, the channel through which matter and spacetime curved into our universe is severed.
- **End of Growth**: No further intake from the parent universe means the internal universe stops expanding. The structural engine of curvature feeding is gone.
- **Stable Continuation**: Despite the cessation of growth, the internal universe persists with its own memory, energy, and entropy balance. Stars continue to burn, galaxies evolve, and consciousness may still exist.
- **Final Trajectory**: Over immense time:
  - Entropy rises toward maximum.
  - Energy disperses.
  - Structure degrades.
  - The universe reaches thermal equilibrium (heat death) or collapses depending on internal asymmetries.

> The black holeâ€™s death is not the end of the universeâ€”  
> it is the end of its **external nourishment**.  
> From that moment, the universe is **on its own**, moving toward structural stillness.

AEH is a pillar of the philosophical theoretical framework "From Darkness to Structure" theoretical, which continues to describe what could happen after the initial universe or 0 (FROM FAT).
