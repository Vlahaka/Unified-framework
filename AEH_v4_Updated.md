# Accretion Expansion Hypothesis

## Origin:
The universe originates from a black hole singularity in a parent universe. The singularity forms a **2D symmetry state (0)**, as defined in the Foundational Asymmetry Theory (FAT). When time curves into this state, awareness and entropy emerge.

## Core Correction:
The black hole does **not stop** after forming the initial 0. It **continues to accumulate** matter and spacetime from the parent universe, feeding into the internal curvature.

This **ongoing intake** expands the internal universeâ€”not through an explosive Big Bang, but as a **growing structure**, like a child being nourished from the outside.

## Dark Energy Reframed:
Dark energy is not a separate, mysterious force. It is the **effect of continuous curvature expansion**, caused by the flow of mass and spacetime into the singularity from the outside universe.

### Reformulated:
> Dark Energy = Structural Effect of External Feeding into the 0

As more matter enters, the 0 grows internally. This growth creates the appearance of expansion from within.

## Structural Consequences:

1. **No Fixed Expansion Point**:
   - Expansion occurs uniformly because the internal curvature is fed everywhere from the outside, not from a single origin.

2. **Ongoing Expansion**:
   - As long as the parent black hole grows, so does our internal universe. This introduces **structural asymmetry** over time.

3. **Dark Energy as a Function**:
   - Dark energy corresponds to the **rate of curvature increase** based on mass-energy intake from the parent universe.

## Summary:

> The universe expands not from an initial explosion, but through continuous intake of mass-energy from a parent black hole.  
> This process defines dark energy as the **curvature growth** of the internal universe.  
> AEH now frames the cosmos as **a growing child**, not a one-time event.


### ðŸ”š Terminal Phase: Black Hole Decay and the End of External Growth

As predicted by Hawking radiation, the parent black hole from which our universe originates will eventually decay. This decay marks a critical structural transition:

- **Causal Decoupling**: Once the black hole decays, the channel through which matter and spacetime curved into our universe is severed.
- **End of Growth**: No further intake from the parent universe means the internal universe stops expanding. The structural engine of curvature feeding is gone.
- **Stable Continuation**: Despite the cessation of growth, the internal universe persists with its own memory, energy, and entropy balance. Stars continue to burn, galaxies evolve, and consciousness may still exist.
- **Final Trajectory**: Over immense time:
  - Entropy rises toward maximum.
  - Energy disperses.
  - Structure degrades.
  - The universe reaches thermal equilibrium (heat death) or collapses depending on internal asymmetries.

> The black holeâ€™s death is not the end of the universeâ€”  
> it is the end of its **external nourishment**.  
> From that moment, the universe is **on its own**, moving toward structural stillness.
