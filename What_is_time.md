Abstract

This paper challenges the dominant scientific view that time emerges from motion, entropy, or relational change. By demonstrating that all such models collapse into contradiction when confronted with the question of what existed before the Big Bang, we propose a reversal of premise: time is not emergent, but the only truly infinite and fundamental entity. We show that entropy requires a finite container and that change is only possible when time interacts with this bounded symmetry. Through this contact, entropy rises from perfect order (zero), initiating the structural emergence of the universe. Unlike models that derive time from within the universe, our framework positions time as the precondition for any emergence, resolving longstanding paradoxes across cosmology, thermodynamics, and quantum theory. This reconceptualization restores structural coherence to our understanding of time and redefines the origin of existence as a consequence of time touching the finite.

SECTION 1: Time in Known Science

How time is currently defined, interpreted, and applied across major disciplines

1.1 In Classical Physics

Time is treated as an independent parameter—a universal ticking clock that flows uniformly for all observers. It provides a fixed background against which objects move and events occur. Newton described it as:

> “Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external.”



In this view:

Time exists independently of matter or motion.

It is continuous, infinite, and unchanging.

All dynamics are described as functions of time:
e.g., x(t) for position over time.


1.2 In Relativity (Einstein)

Einstein restructured time by merging it with space to form spacetime:

Time is no longer absolute.

It is relative to the observer’s velocity and gravitational field.

Clocks run slower near massive bodies or when moving fast (time dilation).


Key principles:

Proper time (experienced locally) differs from coordinate time (measured externally).

Despite being relative, time still exists as a measurable dimension—with one direction.


1.3 In Thermodynamics

Time is linked to entropy—the measure of disorder. The second law of thermodynamics states:

> Entropy in a closed system never decreases.



This gives time a direction:

From low entropy (ordered) to high entropy (disordered).

This “arrow of time” defines the irreversibility of events—e.g., you can scramble an egg, but not unscramble it.


In this view:

Time’s passage is defined by increasing disorder.

It is not fundamental, but a result of physical state transitions.


1.4 In Quantum Mechanics

Time is treated as a fixed external parameter, unlike position or momentum, which are operators subject to uncertainty.

The Schrödinger equation evolves a quantum state as a function of time (iħ∂Ψ/∂t = HΨ).

Time itself is not quantized.

There is no consensus on whether time is fundamental or emergent from entanglement or other quantum correlations.


Notably:

Measurement and collapse imply a before and after, suggesting time is still needed to describe transitions.


1.5 In Cosmology (Big Bang Framework)

Time is said to begin at the Big Bang:

“Before” the Big Bang, time did not exist.

The universe expanded from an initial singularity, creating space and time.


This leads to contradictions:

Inflation requires change in a state where time supposedly didn’t exist.

Many models treat time as emergent from energy fluctuations, geometry, or quantum states—while still using time-based equations to describe these.


1.6 In Philosophy

Time is interpreted through two dominant lenses:

Substantivalism (Newtonian): Time exists as a real entity, regardless of what happens.

Relationism (Leibnizian): Time is only the relation between events; if nothing changes, time does not exist.


Other perspectives:

Presentism: Only the present is real.

Eternalism (Block Universe): Past, present, and future all equally exist—change is an illusion.

Growing Block: The past and present exist, the future does not.


Despite their differences, all require “before and after” to define experience, perception, or motion.

1.7 Conclusion

What do all these models of time ultimately reveal? When confronted with the foundational question—"What existed before the Big Bang?"—they falter into contradiction. Each framework either posits an undefined emergence of time from a timeless state, or invokes change without a coherent temporal substrate. This reveals a structural flaw:

> Any theory that requires a contradiction at its base—such as change without time—is, by the standards of science itself, an untenable premise.



Thus, the prevailing scientific paradigms, though diverse in detail, converge on a shared failure: they cannot reconcile the origin of time without negating their own assumptions.

SECTION 2: Entropy Requires a Finite Container

The structural limits of change and the necessity of boundedness

Entropy—as defined in thermodynamics, information theory, and statistical mechanics—is always measured within a defined system. Whether it is a gas in a box, a quantum register, or a black hole, entropy presupposes a boundary. The very concept of entropy depends on a contrast between possible and actual configurations, which requires constraint.

In other words:

No boundaries, no entropy.

No structure, no distinction.


A truly infinite domain cannot harbor entropy, because without limitation, all possibilities are equally accessible and indistinguishable. Entropy measures distribution across finite degrees of freedom. If degrees of freedom are infinite and unconstrained, entropy is undefined.

This leads to the following logical structure:

1. Entropy is the measure of structural differentiation within a system.


2. For differentiation to occur, the system must be finite.


3. Therefore, entropy can only exist in a finite container.



Now consider this: change requires entropy.

If nothing distinguishes "before" from "after," there is no change.

If all states are equally probable and indistinguishable, there is no progression, no development.


So the existence of change requires the presence of entropy, and entropy requires a finite structure in which it can arise.

This implies:

> The precondition for change is not energy or geometry, but bounded asymmetry.



Hence, we must ask: If entropy and change require a finite domain, what is the only entity capable of initiating transformation without itself requiring containment?

The answer, as we shall show, is Time.

SECTION 3: Time is the Only Infinite

Extracting time from the illusion of emergent motion

Time is not the result of motion. It is the precondition for motion.

All known physical theories treat time as either a measurable effect, a parameter of systems in flux, or a relational quality between changing states. In each case, motion is taken to reveal time.

But this approach is structurally inverted.

> Motion cannot occur without a medium through which "before" and "after" can be distinguished.



This medium is Time.

Unlike entropy, matter, or space—which all require form, structure, and finiteness—Time requires none. It does not need a container. It does not require motion. It simply is.

Properties of Time (Fundamental Definition)

Infinite: It is not bounded by size, scope, or content.

Directional: Even when undisturbed, it points forward.

Non-material: It carries no mass, charge, or energy.

Non-local: It is not anchored to any region of space.

Pre-experiential: It exists whether or not change is observed.


Thus, we redefine Time not as an emergent illusion from changing systems, but as the eternal precondition that enables change to emerge at all.

From this point forward, all structural logic must treat Time as the only infinite entity, from which all emergence must unfold.

Next, we will show how contact between Time and a finite system initiates entropy, awareness, and distinction.

SECTION 4: Contact — When Time Touches the Finite

The origin of emergence, entropy, and existence itself

If Time is the only infinite entity, and entropy only arises within a bounded structure, then the origin of the universe must be the contact between these two:

> Infinite Time + Finite Symmetry = Emergence



Before the Big Bang, Time exists—not as a clock or an emergent effect, but as an infinite field, a directional mathematical void. Within this field exist countless potential 0s—finite, symmetrical containers of undisturbed matter and latent awareness.

Let us consider the state "before" the Big Bang—not as a temporal sequence, but as a condition:

A perfectly symmetrical, motionless, finite field

Containing evenly distributed potential (matter)

No entropy, no change, no identity


This is the true zero—not a void of nothingness, but a container of undisturbed potential.

When Time touches this symmetrical zero, the following occur simultaneously:

1. Distinction arises: before and after are now possible.


2. Entropy emerges: asymmetry begins to form.


3. Change becomes meaningful.



This moment is not an explosion or expansion, but a structural rupture—a fracture in perfect symmetry caused by the infinite directional force of Time.

Because entropy can only rise from a state of zero, and because Time is required to define that rise, this explains both the origin of the arrow of time and the structural inevitability of the universe.

Thus:

There was something before the Big Bang: a symmetrical container.

Change did not cause time. Time caused change.

Entropy did not drift upward from chaos. It ruptured upward from perfect order.


This model resolves the contradiction faced by all previous frameworks: it explains change without requiring time to emerge from change.

> Time is not born at the Big Bang. The Big Bang is born from the touch of Time.

SECTION 5: The Collapse of Emergent-Time Models

Why time cannot be the product of motion

Known science often frames time as an emergent property—a result of motion, entropy, or quantum decoherence. But this leads to an unavoidable contradiction.

When asked the question "What existed before the Big Bang?" emergent-time models are forced to posit change without time or causality without sequence. In doing so, they trigger a logical collapse:

> They imply a decrease of entropy below zero.



But entropy, by definition, cannot fall beneath perfect order (0). No physical or informational system allows for negative entropy without invoking paradox or negating causality.

This means:

The very act of proposing a state before time, while describing its transition, is structurally impossible.

The contradiction arises because time is treated as a product of the very dynamics that require it.


Our model avoids this entirely. By treating Time as infinite and primary:

Entropy always begins at 0.

Change only occurs once Time touches a finite field.

There is no contradiction, no loop, and no need for imaginary preconditions.


Thus, our conclusion is clear:

> Time is not created. Time is the creator. Change is not the origin of time. It is its consequence. Entropy does not begin at randomness. It begins at zero.



All coherent emergence must begin with Time as the infinite origin.
