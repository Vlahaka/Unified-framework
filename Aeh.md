# AEH – Accretion Expansion Hypothesis

# Accretion Expansion Hypothesis (AEH) – Original Draft (Outdated)

> ⚠️ **Notice – This Version Is Outdated**  
> As of June 23, 2025, new scientific insight (specifically, that **black holes grow over time by accumulating matter and spacetime**) has made parts of this original AEH framework inconsistent with known physics.

> The updated version of AEH corrects this and now integrates **dark energy** as the effect of continuous accretion by the black hole that birthed our universe.  
> Please refer to the corrected version here: [AEH v4 – Updated](./AEH_v4_Updated.md)

## AEH – Updated version (For Historical Record)

1. The universe originates from a black hole singularity in a parent universe.
2. The singularity forms a 2D zero (0) state where perfect symmetry is achieved.
3. Time curves into the singularity and touches the 0, initiating awareness and entropy (per FAT).
4. The black hole continues to absorb matter and spacetime from the parent universe.
5. This absorption feeds the internal curvature (our universe), causing ongoing expansion.
6. Dark energy is redefined as the effect of continuous matter/time transfer into the 0, expanding the internal universe.
7. The universe has no fixed expansion center because the growth is driven by curvature from the black hole, thus the expansion of the universe does not have a fixed source.

## Correction Summary

- The **original AEH** did not fully account for the **continued growth of black holes** after their formation.
- This led to **logical tension with dark energy**, initially framed as an illusion or misinterpretation.
- The **updated AEH** recognizes that **black hole growth = continued feeding of the 0**, and that **dark energy is not contradictory**, but a *direct structural effect* of this process.

🌌 Overview

AEH (Accretion Expansion Hypothesis) challenges the conventional view that the universe is expanding due to a mysterious “dark energy.” Instead, it proposes a grounded, structure-based explanation: the redshift we observe is a gravitational effect, not a spatial one.


---

🔬 Core Idea

The universe appears to be expanding not because galaxies are flying apart, but because matter is accumulating into heavier, denser forms. As a result, gravitational curvature intensifies and space between structures stretches unevenly, increasing tension in the cosmic lattice.

This bending of space changes how light travels—causing it to redshift, not due to velocity but due to climbing out of gravitational wells.

🧩 Key Principles

1. Mass Accretion Over Time:

Matter collapses into denser forms (stars, galaxies, black holes).

Mass density increases locally, not universally.



2. Void Expansion is Illusory:

What appears to be space stretching is actually tension from deeper curvature between collapsed nodes of mass.



3. Redshift from Gravity, Not Motion:

Light redshifts more over time due to increasing gravitational gradient.

Distant early-universe light encountered less curvature, so redshift appears less than expected.



4. Hubble Tension Solved Structurally:

Local measurements (where curvature is stronger) show a higher Hubble constant.

Early-universe models (less curvature) predict a lower one.

The tension is not in space, but in asymmetric gravitational development.

🔭 Observational Alignment

Gravitational lensing effects increase with mass clustering—directly supports AEH.

No requirement for dark energy, inflation, or extra dimensions.

Explains galactic drift and shape formation through structural logic.

🔁 AEH in the Unified Framework

AEH is structurally nested within FAT (Foundational Asymmetry Theory). Once symmetry is broken and entropy begins, matter collapses under its own asymmetry, which over time leads to gravitational curvature and tension.

Redshift is therefore not a sign of acceleration, but of emergent gravity-induced time distortion.

📌 Summary Statement

> The universe is not expanding. It is collapsing into complexity. The illusion of expansion is light escaping from increasing gravity.
