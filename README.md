## Overview
This repository contains the complete body of work surrounding the Unified Framework, a structural cosmological model built from first principles. It integrates metaphysical reasoning with structured causal emergence to explain the origin of reality, matter, time, identity, and consciousness.

The framework is composed of multiple independent but interconnected theories, each exploring a specific aspect of cosmic structure, recursive logic, and identity formation.

**Summary**  
This condensed paper presents the **Unified Scaffold: From Darkness to Structure**, a comprehensive ontological framework that redefines the origin of time, matter, awareness, and structure.  
It integrates five core models‚Äî**FAT**, **AEH**, **ASC**, **CRSM**, and **IRATA**‚Äîinto a single causal chain from primordial symmetry to real-world phenomena such as cosmic redshift and black hole recursion.

## Landmark Paper

- **[Structural_Emergence_From_Infinite_Fields.md](./Unified-framework-main/Structural_Emergence_From_Infinite_Fields.md)** ‚Äì This is the metaphysical foundation of the entire framework, where the 0 (zero) emerges from the contrast between infinite Darkness and structured Time. It explains the precondition for existence itself.
