# Unified Framework – Metaphysical and Structural Cosmology
**Author:** Vlad Ionut Daniel

## Overview
This repository contains the complete body of work surrounding the Unified Framework, a structural cosmological model built from first principles. It integrates metaphysical reasoning with structured causal emergence to explain the origin of reality, matter, time, identity, and consciousness.

The framework is composed of multiple independent but interconnected theories, each exploring a specific aspect of cosmic structure, recursive logic, and identity formation.

## Core Framework Files

- **[Fat.md](./Unified-framework-main/Fat.md)** – Foundational Asymmetry Theory (FAT): Defines the emergence of identity, entropy, and awareness through symmetry breaking.
- **[Aeh.md](./Unified-framework-main/Aeh.md)** – Accretion Expansion Hypothesis (AEH): Redefines redshift and cosmic structure through gravitational collapse.
- **[Asc.md](./Unified-framework-main/Asc.md)** – Architecture of Stabilized Consciousness (ASC): Explains the persistence and structure of consciousness through recursive pattern locking.
- **[Crsm.md](./Unified-framework-main/Crsm.md)** – Cognitive Recursion Safety Matrix: A 40-zone safety structure for protecting minds from paradox and recursion overload.
- **[IRATA_Photon_Application.md](./Unified-framework-main/IRATA_Photon_Application.md)** – Division by Zero as Emergence Logic and the Photon Test.

## Landmark Paper

- **[Structural_Emergence_From_Infinite_Fields.md](./Unified-framework-main/Structural_Emergence_From_Infinite_Fields.md)** – This is the metaphysical foundation of the entire framework, where the 0 (zero) emerges from the contrast between infinite Darkness and structured Time. It explains the precondition for existence itself.

- **[JWST Observations with the FAT-AEH Framework.md](./Unified-framework-main/JWST Observations with the FAT-AEH Framework.md)** – Observational alignment of theoretical predictions with JWST redshift data.
- **[black_hole_emergence_chain.md](./Unified-framework-main/black_hole_emergence_chain.md)** – Describes recursive universe formation via black holes.
- **[black_holes_as_anchors.md](./Unified-framework-main/black_holes_as_anchors.md)** – Philosophical function of black holes in cosmic structure.

## Author Note

This work was developed independently and submitted to scientific and AI institutions as a complete structural framework. It has been reviewed by both human researchers and LLMs for logical consistency. It is intended as both a metaphysical philosophy and a testable structure theory.
