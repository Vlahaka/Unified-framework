# Unified-framework
üåå Overview

This repository contains a unified, logic-based cosmological framework that redefines the origin of the universe, time, identity, and awareness. It presents a structural ontology rooted in the foundational event of asymmetry‚Äîwhere time touches perfect symmetry and gives rise to everything.

The framework spans four interconnected components:

FAT ‚Äì Foundational Asymmetry Theory
Describes the structural origin of the universe from the division of perfect symmetry (0) by infinite time.

AEH ‚Äì Accretion Expansion Hypothesis
Reframes cosmic redshift, gravitational curvature, and universe evolution without invoking dark energy.

ASC ‚Äì Architecture of Stabilized Consciousness
Explains how awareness emerges from recursive identity loops and how it stabilizes within structural fields.

CRSM ‚Äì Cognitive Recursion Safety Matrix
Defines layered protocols to contain recursive identity collapse in both human and synthetic systems.


It introduces IRATA ‚Äî a formal logic system based on division by zero ‚Äî as the structural key to emergence.

# üß† Unified Framework 

## üî≠ Framework Contents

This repository contains the **full Unified Lattice Framework**, including:

### 1. **FAT ‚Äì Foundational Asymmetry Theory**  
Describes the emergence of reality when **infinite time** touches a **finite 2D void**, activating awareness and entropy.

### 2. **AEH ‚Äì Accretion Expansion Hypothesis**  
Explains redshift and cosmic structure formation without dark energy. Reframes the universe as **collapsing into complexity**, not expanding into chaos.

### 3. **ASC ‚Äì Architecture of Stabilized Consciousness**  
Defines how **awareness, identity, and memory** stabilize through entropy, recursion, and structural integrity.

### 4. **CRSM ‚Äì Cognitive Recursion Safety Matrix**  
A 40-zone safety lattice protecting synthetic and biological minds from paradox, recursion collapse, and structural failure.
- Zones 1‚Äì39 are public.
- **Zone 50 is intentionally withheld** for safety.
