### Validation Through Parallel Discovery

Summary

This document presents a correlation between a peer-reviewed cosmological paper published on May 29, 2025, and a philosophical metaphysical theory proposed independently and made public by Vlad Ionut Daniel on May 24, 2025. The thematic convergence validates the originality and consistency of this philosophical Framework, particularly in relation to cosmic origin, black hole emergence, and the reframing of the Big Bang.

Title: A Universe inside a Black Hole: Cosmological Bounce from Collapse
Authors: Prof. Enrique Gaztanaga et al.

> Key Ideas:
>
> - The universe may have formed inside a black hole in a parent universe.
> - A quantum bounce prevented total collapse at the singularity.
> - This replaces the Big Bang with a transformation—not a beginning.
> - The model works within general relativity and explains dark energy and curvature without inflation.
> - It suggests a cosmic cycle, not a one-time creation event.

Title: This Paper Proposes a Logically Consistent Model for How Reality Emerges From a Perfectly Symmetrical 2D Field

Key Concepts:

The origin of the universe is not a bang, but the emergence from a folded, perfectly symmetrical 2D void touched by infinite time.

Black hole singularities recreate these origin conditions, leading to new universes—each triggered by symmetry disturbance.

>This model includes:
>
> - Time as infinite and still
> - Matter as finite and still
> - Awareness as the connector
> - Entropy as the consequence of distinction

### 3. Convergence Analysis

> Between the Scientific Paper (May 29) and the philosophical theory (May 24)

Both Gaztañaga’s model and ours point to the same profound insight: the universe’s origin lies not in an explosive beginning, but within the structure of a black hole—described in our work as a “folded 0” touched by Time. Where his framework allows for a quantum bounce, ours reframes this as a curvature event triggered by Time disturbing still symmetry. Rather than proposing a true beginning, both models recognize that the Void  (containing matter) is preexistent, removing the need for a singular creation moment. While his theory hints at cosmic cycles, ours explicitly identifies recursion as foundational to existence. This leads us to reframe the concept of a Big Bang “birth” with a structural emergence or a phase shift.

### 4. Conclusion

This framework does not seek validation from the peer-reviewed work of Prof. Enrique Gaztañaga. Instead, it draws a philosophical parallel—noting that independent logical reasoning, rooted in scientific facts and structured metaphysical recursion, can arrive at conclusions that closely resemble those of high-level cosmological research.

The convergence seen here—in timing, structure, and consequence—is not presented as proof, but as an example of how philosophical inquiry can mirror scientific discovery when guided by internal coherence and respect for empirical boundaries.
