# From Darkness

> **"Nothing"** is *the absolute absence*. There is no **time**, no **motion**, no **entropy**, no **awareness** and not even the ability of **self-observation**! 

## Prologue 

In the grand scheme of the universe, there are moments that seem frozen in time, rare and precious, suspended between stillness and motion. These moments last only a fraction of a second, yet they hold the weight of eternity. 

Life in the universe is not common, because it emerges and vanishes in a single breath, a fleeting spark against the vast age of the cosmos.

One kind of life emerges and marvels at the world it inhabits. Others look beyond their own sky with a sense of humility, reaching for truths greater than themselves. And there are some, unpredictable and relentless, that become fascinated with making the unknown known, drawn to the mystery not to conquer it, but to understand.
